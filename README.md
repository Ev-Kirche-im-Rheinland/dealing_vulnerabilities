# dealing_vulnerabilities

## Vulnerability classification
- Security updates must be applied in a timely manner to safeguard the organization's it-systems from known vulnerabilities.
- Patches should be deployed according to the schedule below unless the firm prevents it.

### high severity level
- High severity CVEs are those with a documented CVSS severity greater than 7.0
- It is a best practice in standards such as PCI DSS to remediate or patch high severity vulnerabilities within 45 days. 
### medium severity level
- Medium severity CVEs are those with a documented CVSS severity between 4.0 and 6.9
- It is a best practice to remediate or patch medium severity vulnerabilities within 90 days. 
### low severity level
- Low severity CVEs are those with a documented CVSS severity below 4.0
- It is a best practice to remediate or patch low severity vulnerabilities within 120 days. 

## vulnerability scanning
- A vulnerability scanner will be used to scan all items on the organization's it-systems to find flaws in system setup and to see if any systems are missing crucial patches or applications.
- The network of the organization will be inspected at least once a quarter.
- To determine the availability of firmware patches, the websites of vendors of servers, PCs, tablets, printers, switches, routers, and peripherals will be examined.
- Missing fixes discovered during vulnerability scanning will be applied as soon as possible.â€¨Any flaws discovered will be addressed.
